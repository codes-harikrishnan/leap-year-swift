# Leap Year iOS

This is an iOS app that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not.

## Problem Statement

Analyse if an year provided is a leap year or not based on the following rules:

-   A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4
-   It should not be divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400
